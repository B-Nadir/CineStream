# CineStream
CineStream is a movie discovery and streaming availability application. It allows users to search for movies and retrieve metadata such as posters, descriptions, ratings, and streaming platform availability (Netflix, Prime Video, Hotstar, YouTube). The API will be used only to fetch movie information and update the CineStream database for non-commercial research and development purposes.
